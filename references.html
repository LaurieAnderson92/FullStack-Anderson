            <p>Vice President, Head of Supportability</p>
            <p class="page-content-reference">I highly recommend Laurie for their exceptional intelligence, courage, and remarkable ability to ask the tough questions. As a colleague and team member, Laurie consistently demonstrated a level of brilliance and fearlessness that truly set them apart.
                <br>
                <br>
                Laurie possesses an exceptional intellect that enables them to grasp complex concepts quickly and find innovative solutions to challenging problems. Their sharp analytical skills and deep understanding of their field make them an invaluable asset to any team. I have witnessed Laurie consistently tackle the most difficult projects with enthusiasm and determination, delivering outstanding results time and time again.
                <br>
                <br>
                What truly sets Laurie apart is their courage to ask the tough questions that others may shy away from. They fearlessly challenge the status quo, pushing the boundaries of conventional thinking and inspiring those around them to think critically. Laurie's ability to identify key issues, analyze them from various angles, and propose insightful solutions has been instrumental in driving our team's success.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to their intellectual prowess, Laurie is an exceptional team player. They possess a natural ability to collaborate and inspire others, creating an environment that fosters teamwork, creativity, and growth. Their humility and willingness to listen to diverse perspectives make them an approachable and supportive colleague, ensuring that everyone feels valued and heard.
                <br>
                <br>
                Laurie's remarkable combination of intelligence, courage, and team spirit make them an outstanding professional. I have no doubt that they will continue to excel in any endeavor they undertake. It is an absolute pleasure to work alongside Laurie and I wholeheartedly recommend them to any organization looking for a brilliant mind, a courageous spirit, and an exceptional team player.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelleroseannmiller/">Michelle Lewis-Miller, MBA</a></h2>
            <p>Vice President, Head of Strategy and Transformation</p>
            <p class="page-content-reference">Laurie is one of the few people I would feel comfortable describing as a closet strategist, but that is precisely what he is. My role was to lead Strategy and Transformation for SAP Concur Product Support, where his role was to troubleshoot complex technical issues as a Support Engineer and also provide more specialized, in-region support expertise. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Because of my role, I often had the pleasure of hearing Laurie's thoughts on changes or projects rolling down across the organization--it was something I valued and sought. Just as many car mechanics have the ability to visualize an engine in their heads to help with diagnosis, Laurie has the ability to visualize a change and conceptualize the way it will impact other areas of the business or its long-term objectives. Therefore, I could count on him to raise concerns or impacts that others--including me--may have missed. I can count multiple occasions where this strategic thinking helped to improve the end result. For example, he once observed that the lack of a specific piece of information in some newly revised customer communication templates might result in an increase of case volumes and longer case resolution times down the road., and he was right!
                <br>
                <br>
                But why do I call Laurie a closet strategist? I do so because he is excellent at tactical execution and this fact tends to overshadow everything else he can do. One of my regrets is that I never got a chance to plug Laurie into a role where he could flex his strategic skills more fully--he left our organization while I was seeking to arrange a shadowing opportunity. That is more our loss than his!
                <br>
                <br>
                I can heartily recommend Laurie for any role that involves managing several complex pieces of information to produce an outcome that meets target objectives. I can recommend him for any role where asking questions and a passion for finding and doing the right thing is paramount to success. I can also just simply recommend him. Whatever you throw at him, Laurie is the type to figure it out and exceed your expectations.</p>

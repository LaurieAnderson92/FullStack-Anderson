            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was young, I've had a fascination with computers and troubleshooting problems, fueled by an insatiable curiosity for understanding how things work in the digital realm. My journey into the world of technology has not 
                only involved mastering the art of diagnosing and resolving technical issues but also delving into the realm of coding languages. Recognising coding as the backbone of modern computing, I've embraced the challenge of learning 
                various programming languages to enhance my problem-solving capabilities. </p>
                
            <p> Whether it's deciphering the intricacies of Python, mastering the logic of Java, or exploring the versatility of HTML and CSS, I am committed to honing 
                my coding skills to complement my troubleshooting expertise. My passion for learning coding languages stems from a desire to not only understand the inner workings of software but also to leverage this knowledge to innovate 
                and create impactful solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

            <h2>What Accessibility Means To Me</h2>
            <p>Colour blindness and visual impairments run in my family and I've grown up around amazing people who have worked to make both the digital world and the real world more accessible.</p>
                
            <p>A core memory of mine is hearing from a cousin who worked as a accessibility consultant for their local government's online accessibility strategy. They were lamenting about how difficult many official webpages were to navigate with a screen 
                reader, and the trend at the time of removing accessible features that were seen to be "unsightly" for the average user. Now that I'm creating websites, I often think back to that moment and push myself to bridge the gap between 
                sleek modern presentation and accessibility with every line of code I write.</p>

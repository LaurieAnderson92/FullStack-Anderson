## Setup
A section was used rather than a footer so that it can move up the screen in browser view and from the contacts section

## Deployment
Git Hub Pages

## Testing:
Test the website locally by opening the HTML files in a web browser to ensure everything displays correctly.

## Deployment:

## Bugs/Issues:

Bug1: The Title box displays over the nav-toggle window
Fix: deployed a Z Axis and moved nav toggle window to be inline with convention

Bug2: The title-picture is displaying above the title-box
Fix: Used flex box and absolute positioning

Bug3: Title-picture seems to be cut off, not a perfect circle
